## Overview

This project involves creating a series of Tableau visualizations to track and analyze progress in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) tasks and Study tasks. The visualizations provide insights into task completion status, priority distribution, and overall progress.

## Project Structure

- **Data Source:** The dataset used in this project includes various tasks related to DSA and Study, along with their respective priorities, completion status, and dates.
- **Visualizations:**
  - **Task Completion Status Over Time:** A line chart showing the progression of task completion over time for both DSA and Study tasks.
  - **Priority Distribution:** Pie charts displaying the distribution of tasks based on their priority levels for both DSA and Study.
  - **Study vs. DSA Status:** Side-by-side bar charts comparing the completion status of Study tasks and DSA tasks.
  - **DSA Priority vs. Study Priority:** A treemap visualizing the distribution of tasks based on their priority levels.
  - **Completion Heatmap:** A matrix-style heatmap showing the completion status of each task over time.
  - **Scorecards:** Displaying the percentage progress in DSA and Study tasks.

## Visualizations

### 1. Task Completion Status Over Time
- **Description:** This line chart tracks the progress of both DSA and Study tasks over time, showing when tasks were completed, not started, or not completed.

### 2. Priority Distribution (DSA and Study)
- **Description:** Pie charts illustrating the distribution of tasks based on their priority (High, Medium, Low) for both DSA and Study tasks.

### 3. Study vs. DSA Status
- **Description:** Side-by-side bar charts comparing the completion status (Completed, Not Completed, Not Started) of Study tasks and DSA tasks.

### 4. DSA Priority vs. Study Priority Treemap
- **Description:** A treemap that shows the distribution of tasks based on their priority levels for both DSA and Study.

### 5. Completion Heatmap
- **Description:** A matrix-style heatmap representing the completion status of each task over time, helping to identify patterns in task completion.

### 6. Scorecards
- **Description:** Scorecards providing a quick overview of the percentage progress in DSA and Study tasks.

## How to Use

1. **Dataset:** Load the provided dataset into Tableau.
2. **Visualizations:** Use the steps outlined in the project to create each visualization.
3. **Analysis:** Explore the visualizations to gain insights into task progress and prioritize areas that need attention.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive view of task management and progress in DSA and Study areas. The visualizations help identify patterns, prioritize tasks, and track progress over time.
